# 𝔃ino ❤︎
## My custom C++ based Arduino Library
### NO DELAY, blah 😝
### ZERO COMPILER WARNING 😈

> Note

I don't like Arduino IDE for many reasons, so usually I use [Atom](https://atom.io/) text-editor with [Platform IO](http://platformio.org/platformio-ide) as the main editor for my embedded systems projects and the library works very well with it.

However, I did NOT test the library on the Arduino IDE, so please notify me if you get any warning/error!
