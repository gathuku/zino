## My custom C++ based Arduino Library
### NO DELAY, blah 😝

> Note

I don't like Arduino IDE for many reasons, so usually I use Atom text-editor with PlatformIO
as the main editor for my embedded systems projects and the library works very well with it.

However, I did NOT test the library on the Arduino IDE, so please notify me if you get any error!
